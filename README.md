# Construction-Spending-Specs-

This repository holds X-13ARIMA-SEATS specification files, which were used by US Census Bureau staff to seasonally adjust public Construction Spending data. These are ASCII files containing settings that are required by X-13ARIMA-SEATS. The specification files are organized by year, 2015 through 2024, with one file for each time series. There is a text file that maps the titles to series names.

These files are public, and are released to inform interested parties of research	and to encourage discussion. The files were reviewed by the Disclosure Review Board (DRB). The DRB approval number is CBDRB‑FY25‑CSRM001-0004.
